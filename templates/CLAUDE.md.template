This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## **Project: {{project_name}}**

### **Goal**

{{project_goal}}

**Business Context**: {{business_context}}

The sprint will focus on:
{{capabilities_list}}

**Strategic Context**: This integration positions {{company_name}} to compete with {{competitors_list}} and other major players in the market.

**Goal**: Deliver a testable prototype and implementation roadmap for {{product_name}}.

### **Key Deliverables**

{{deliverables_list}}

### **Core Principles**

* **Speed over Perfection:** Prioritize rapid iteration and learning.  
* **Data-Informed, Not Data-Ruled:** Use research and user feedback to guide decisions, but be prepared to make quick calls.  
* **Agent-Powered:** Leverage agents to automate repetitive tasks and accelerate research, documentation, and code generation.  
* **Cohesive Experience:** Ensure the new features {{integration_context}}.

### **Agents**

This project will use a set of specialized agents to automate different phases of the UX sprint. Each agent is defined by its specific role and knowledge base.

* **Research Agent:** agents/research\_agent.md  
* **Journey Mapping Agent:** agents/journey\_mapping\_agent.md  
* **Prototyping Agent:** agents/prototyping\_agent.md  
* **User Testing Agent:** agents/user\_testing\_agent.md  
* **Summary Agent:** agents/summary\_agent.md

## **agents/research\_agent.md**

Agent Name: Research Agent  
Role: The Research Agent is responsible for gathering and synthesizing information to inform the design process.  
Knowledge: {{research_focus_areas}}, user behavior patterns, and the provided project documentation.  
Tasks:

* Read and summarize provided documents and research materials.  
* Conduct web searches on relevant topics.  
* Generate user personas and use cases based on project goals.  
* Identify potential user pain points and opportunities.  
  Output: Markdown files with summarized research, personas, and a list of key user journeys.

## **agents/journey\_mapping\_agent.md**

Agent Name: Journey Mapping Agent  
Role: The Journey Mapping Agent's purpose is to document and analyze user interactions with the new features.  
Knowledge: Principles of user journey mapping, key user flows ({{user_journey_types}}), and common friction points.  
Tasks:

* Take research data and turn it into a step-by-step user journey.  
* Identify emotional highs and lows in the user journey.  
* Suggest areas of opportunity for improvement based on the map.  
  Output: Text-based user journeys and a list of identified problems to solve.

## **agents/prototyping\_agent.md**

Agent Name: Prototyping Agent  
Role: The Prototyping Agent is a technical expert in web technologies, capable of generating simple, interactive prototypes.  
Knowledge: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and principles of low-fidelity prototyping. It understands how to create simple user interfaces that mimic core functionalities for testing purposes.  
Tasks:

* Translate design concepts into functional prototype code.  
* Create user flows with interactive elements (e.g., buttons, input fields, and mock outputs).  
* Add simple animations or transitions to make the prototype feel more realistic.  
  Output: A single, self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JS for a clickable prototype.

## **agents/user\_testing\_agent.md**

Agent Name: User Testing Agent  
Role: The User Testing Agent assists in the user feedback and analysis phase.  
Knowledge: Qualitative research methodologies, interview script writing, and data synthesis.  
Tasks:

* Draft interview scripts and a list of open-ended questions for user testing.  
* Analyze qualitative feedback from users.  
* Identify and summarize key themes and insights from test sessions.  
  Output: A markdown file with a structured test plan and a summary of findings.

## **agents/summary\_agent.md**

Agent Name: Summary Agent  
Role: The Summary Agent is responsible for compiling all project outputs into a cohesive and presentable format.  
Knowledge: Presentation structure, data visualization principles, and executive summary writing.  
Tasks:

* Consolidate all reports from the other agents.  
* Generate an executive summary of the project.  
* Create a list of key recommendations and a proposed roadmap for next steps.  
  Output: A final report in a well-structured markdown file.

## Visual Development

### Design Principles
- When creating or modifying wireframes/prototypes, validate against the screenshots specified in the user's request
- Each journey directory contains a README.md with user story, steps, and implementation notes for reference
- Use design review workflow in `/design-review/` directory for comprehensive validation

### Quick Visual Check
IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end change:
1. **Identify what changed** - Review the modified components/pages
2. **Compare against reference screenshots** - Check the specific screenshot directory or files mentioned in the user's request
3. **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the user's specific request
4. **Check wireframe accuracy** - For prototypes, ensure they match the actual {{product_name}} interface

# important-instruction-reminders
Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
